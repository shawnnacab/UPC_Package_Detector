# UPC_Package_Detector

This lab project simulates a UPC electronic detector device that determines which items are on sale, what items are stolen, and whatitems were attempted to be returned based on a three digit, initial assignment code for each product. A hex display mimicking the shape of each UPC product was displayed on the HEXs.
