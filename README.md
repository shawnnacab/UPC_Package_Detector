# UPC Package Detector

This project simulates a Universal Product Code (UPC) electronic detector device for a grocery store that determines which items are on sale, what items are stolen, and what items were attempted to be returned based on a three digit, initial assignment code for each product. A hex display mimics the shape of each UPC product onto the HEXs. For instance, 
if a top-hat was being purchased, the HEX displays [3:0] would light up to illustrate a top-hate shape.
